------PURPOSE OF MANAGE.PY-------         
    - `manage.py` is a command-line utility for administrative tasks in Django projects.
    - It is automatically created when you start a Django project.
    - It is essential for running commands such as starting the development server, running tests, and creating database migration
    # ------- PURPOSE OF SETTINGS.PY------
    The settings.py file is where you configure all the settings for your Django project. This includes things like your database connection, installed apps, middleware, and security settings. It's like the control center for your entire Django project.
    # ROLE OF MVT
    In Django's MVT pattern, the Model handles data and interacts with the database. The View is like the logic layer, processing user requests and fetching data from the Model. Finally, the Template is the presentation layer, defining how the data is displayed to the user.

    ------TWO ADVANTAGES OF BATTARIES INCLUDED------
    First, you get a lot of features ready to go, which makes building web apps faster.
    Second, since everyone uses the same tools, Django projects tend to be more consistent and easier to understand.
